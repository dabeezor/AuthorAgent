 * context builder through a narrow `EnginePort` interface (composition, not a
 * god-object). The message handler, step-service bundle, and context engine
 * are passed in so behavior — thresholds, retry counts, word-count
 * continuation, quality loop, file-save/context-engine/auto-narrate/assembly
